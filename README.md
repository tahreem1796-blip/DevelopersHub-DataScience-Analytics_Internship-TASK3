 Task Overview: Customer Churn Prediction (Bank Customers)
🎯 Objective
The goal of this task is to predict which bank customers are likely to leave (churn). By identifying at-risk customers, the bank can take proactive measures to improve retention and reduce losses.

📊 Dataset
- Churn Modelling Dataset
Contains customer demographic details, account information, and churn labels (whether the customer left or stayed).
- Key features include:
- Categorical variables: Geography, Gender
- Numerical variables: Age, Balance, Credit Score, Estimated Salary, etc.
- Target variable: Exited (1 = churned, 0 = retained)

⚙️ Instructions & Workflow
- Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Handle missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
- Normalize/scale numerical features if needed.
- Encoding Categorical Features
- Apply Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding to variables like Geography and Gender.
- Ensure encoded features are suitable for the chosen model.
- Model Training
- Train a supervised classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks).
- Split data into training and testing sets for evaluation.
- Feature Importance Analysis
- Identify which features (e.g., age, balance, geography) most strongly influence churn.
- Use model-specific methods (e.g., feature importance scores in tree-based models, coefficients in logistic regression, or SHAP values).

🛠️ Skills Applied
- Categorical Data Encoding
- Label Encoding
- One-Hot Encoding
- Supervised Classification Modeling
- Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks
- Feature Importance Interpretation
- Understanding which customer attributes drive churn
- Translating model outputs into actionable business insights

✅ Expected Outcome
- A trained classification model that predicts churn with reasonable accuracy.
- Insights into key drivers of churn (e.g., low balance, certain geographies, age groups).
- A foundation for customer retention strategies based on data-driven evidence.
